# Gif-Converter
[Alpine Gif-Converter](https://gifmaker-nazarami20.vercel.app/) is an entirelly browser-based gif-converter. 

## Why use WebAssembly?
WebAssembly allows for rewriting a browser-compatible port of FFMPEG. This WASM package is run entirely in the user's browser, and allows for complete privacy, as no input files are sent to backend databases.
